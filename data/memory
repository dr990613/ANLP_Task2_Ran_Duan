      "content": "A good starting point is to pick a simple dataset (like CIFAR-10), implement a baseline CNN, and then iterate with data augmentation and regularization techniques. We can break it into steps: 1) data loading, 2) baseline model, 3) training loop, 4) evaluation, 5) improvements."

      "content": "What is the main difference between using a simple CNN and using ResNet for image classification?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "A simple CNN stacks convolutional and pooling layers sequentially and often suffers from vanishing gradients when it gets deep. ResNet introduces residual connections (skip connections) that allow gradients to flow more easily through the network, making it possible to train much deeper models. In practice, ResNet is usually more stable and achieves better accuracy for the same or even smaller parameter count."

  "notes": [
    "CNN basics: convolution layers extract local features; pooling layers reduce spatial resolution while keeping important information; deeper layers capture more abstract patterns.",
    "Overfitting in vision models is common. Typical countermeasures: data augmentation (random crop, flip, color jitter), weight decay, dropout, early stopping, and using pretrained backbones.",
    "ResNet idea: learn F(x) = H(x) - x instead of H(x) directly. Residual blocks add input x to the output of a few conv layers, helping gradients flow and enabling very deep networks.",
    "Training tips for image classification: always start with a simple baseline (e.g. small CNN) and verify the pipeline; then move to pretrained models like ResNet or EfficientNet. Monitor both training and validation accuracy/loss.",
    "For small student projects, CIFAR-10 or a subset of ImageNet-like datasets are usually enough to demonstrate the pipeline: data loading, model design, training, evaluation, and error analysis.",
    "Evaluation for CV models should not only report accuracy, but also confusion matrix across classes, per-class recall, and simple visual error analysis (e.g. show misclassified images)."
